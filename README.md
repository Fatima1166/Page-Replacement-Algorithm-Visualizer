# Page-Replacement-Algorithm-Visualizer
📘 Project Introduction: Page Replacement Algorithm Visualizer
In modern operating systems, memory management plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient execution of processes. When the physical memory (RAM) is full, the operating system must decide which memory pages to replace to accommodate new ones — this is where page replacement algorithms come into play. However, understanding these algorithms conceptually can be difficult for students and beginners.

To address this, the Page Replacement Algorithm Visualizer project aims to simulate and visually demonstrate the working of different page replacement algorithms. It provides a user-friendly interface that shows how pages are loaded into memory frames, when page faults occur, and how the algorithms make replacement decisions.

🎯 Objectives:
Simulate and visualize the behavior of various page replacement algorithms.

Help learners understand how memory management and page faults work.

Compare the performance of algorithms using hit ratio and number of page faults.

🧠 Key Features:
Support for multiple algorithms:
🔹 FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
🔹 LRU (Least Recently Used)
🔹 Optimal Page Replacement

Step-by-step visualization of page access and replacement.

Display of key metrics: page faults, page hits, and hit ratio.

Easy input of reference strings and number of memory frames.

👩‍💻 Technologies Used:
Python – core logic and simulation

Matplotlib / Tabulate / Tkinter (or web frontend like HTML/CSS/JS with backend in Python) – for visual and tabular display

Optional: React.js or Flask for web-based interface

📈 Educational Impact:
This project serves as a valuable tool for students studying Operating Systems, providing a clear and interactive way to understand complex memory management concepts.
